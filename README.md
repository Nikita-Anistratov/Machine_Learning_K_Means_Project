Project Overview

This project investigates k-means clustering and explores the effectiveness of k++ initialization over random initialization. It also applies the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and extends these techniques to handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

The project consists of three parts:
	1.	K++ Initialization vs. Random Initialization in K-Means Clustering
	•	Implemented k-means clustering with both random initialization and k++ initialization.
	•	Demonstrated that k++ initialization significantly improves clustering performance by maximizing the initial distance between centroids.
	•	Conducted multiple iterations and plotted the clusters to compare the two approaches.
	•	Found that random initialization leads to inefficient clustering, sometimes leaving clusters with no associated data points.
	2.	Elbow Method for Determining Optimal Number of Clusters
	•	Implemented the elbow method to identify the best number of clusters (k) by plotting coherence measures.
	•	Used k-means clustering on a dataset with different values of k and analyzed the overall coherence of clustering.
	•	Results: Found that k = 4 was the optimal choice for k++ initialization, whereas random initialization lacked consistency.
	3.	Application to Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST Dataset)
	•	Applied k-means clustering with k++ initialization to the first 100 images of the MNIST dataset (each image represented as a 400-dimensional vector).
	•	Used the elbow method to estimate the best k for clustering the digits.
	•	Findings:
	•	The optimal number of clusters was determined to be k = 6, though intuitively, k = 10 would make more sense.
	•	Some clusters achieved 100% accuracy, while others struggled with mixed classifications.
	•	Analyzed success scores for different values of k, showing that k = 10 yielded the highest accuracy.

Key Findings and Insights
	•	K++ Initialization Enhances Clustering Performance:
	•	Produces more efficient clustering than random initialization.
	•	Reduces the number of steps in the k-means optimization process.
	•	Ensures centroids are well-distributed across the data.
	•	Elbow Method Effectiveness:
	•	Helps determine the optimal k value, though its effectiveness varies depending on dataset complexity.
	•	Worked well for low-dimensional datasets but was less clear for high-dimensional image data.
	•	Application to Handwritten Digits:
	•	The elbow method suggested k = 6, but practical application required k = 10.
	•	Some clusters had perfect accuracy, while others contained multiple digit classes.
	•	The method showed promise but required additional tuning for high-dimensional datasets.
